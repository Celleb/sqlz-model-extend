# Typescript Project Skeleton

You can you use this repo to setup your project with typescript.

It has .vscode, eslint, prettier, tsconfig and jest already setup.

This skeleton has the following devDependencies:

- @types/jest
- @types/node,
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
- @typescript-eslint/parser
- jest
- ts-jest
- typescript

I prefer yarn, however, you can replace that with `npm`

## Getting started

Clone this repo and do one of the following:

- Copy the content into your project directory.
- Rename the repo to whatever you desire and update the remote url to that of your project.
